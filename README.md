I wanted to replicate a database to handle social network traffic CRUD operations with MongoDB and Mongoose ORM. These included created an account, making posts, adding friends, adding comments to posts, updating posts and user information, and removing information relative to what was created.

## Requirements

To run the application, a text editor and command line application is required (such as VSCode), with the addition of NodeJS (and dependancies), and the installation of MongoDB for handling our server requirements.
